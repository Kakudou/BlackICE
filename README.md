# 💀 BLACKICE: The Node War

> *Hack the system. Leave a trace. Burn the future into the grid.*

---

## ⚡ TL;DR;

**BLACKICE** is a cyberpunk **multiplayer MUD** (Multi-User Dungeon) where you:
- Build your own server nodes filled with ICE defenses.
- Infiltrate other nodes in real-time, leaving log traces.
- Load and run programs (attack, stealth, utility) using RAM-limited cyberdecks.
- Fight ICE, corrupt logs, spoof messages, and trigger systemic war events.
- All in **full text**, over **CLI / Telnet / Discord / Web**.
- Built with **Python + Evennia**.

**No 3D. No fluff. Just raw digital warfare. ASCII, code, and chaos.**

## 🧠 What is BLACKICE?

BLACKICE is a **text-based cyberpunk infiltration game** where everything reacts to you.

You are a **decker**, a **persona in the cyberspace**, a digital ghost with RAM and a drive.

You jack into the Net to:
- Build your fortress of ICE and databombs.
- Run ops against other players or corp nodes.
- Load stealth, brute force, or sabotage programs.
- Trace enemies through their backdoors.
- Wipe or forge logs before ICE wakes up.
- Talk to corrupted AIs, betray your crew, or burn the whole grid.

The network is **alive**. Nodes are procedurally generated, layered in **Fibonacci spirals** so older players are deep in the core, while new ones grow outward. Travel between nodes takes time. Logs are written. Traces stack. ICE escalates.

And you?  
You're always being watched. Every choice leaves digital fingerprints.

## 🎮 Gameplay Summary

- **Turn-based or Real-time parsing system.**  
  - Command structure like: `connect`, `run ghost()`, `decrypt`, `spoof_trace`, `attack`
- **Programs as objects.**  
  - Limited RAM per deck. Each action costs memory and stability.
- **D20 Roll System.**  
  - Every action resolved by `D20 + Skill + Modifiers vs DC`.
- **Trace and Heat mechanics.**  
  - Trace builds as you act. ICE escalates when thresholds are hit.
- **Combat with ICE or other personas.**  
  - Use `BlackHammer`, `Overflow`, `RAMShield`, and more.
- **ASCII/Map-based Node Architecture.**  
  - Players design and defend their own nodes with logic paths.
- **Loot, Crafting, Black Market.**  
  - ROM blueprints, rare parts, modded gear. Build legendary tools.
- **Comms System is attackable.**  
  - Spoofed DMs, corrupt chat logs, ghost whispers, MITM hacks.
- **Dynamic World.**  
  - Factions, AI outbreaks, trace storms, territory wars.

## 🧨 Devs, Come Bleed With Us

Look—this isn’t some glossy, over-scoped bullshit.  
This game was born from a **dream**. A literal one.  
I woke up, wrote it down, and now I’m carving it into the grid.

**No deadlines. No hierarchy. No pressure.**  
You’re a dev who loves cyberpunk, hacking, or just weird systems?

Then you're in.

### What we need:
- Python devs (even juniors)
- People who like MUDs or parser-based games
- Lovers of weird, raw digital energy
- Writers, designers, node architects, chaos-makers

### What we don’t need:
- 3D artists
- Shader programmers
- UI designers
- Anyone who asks “when’s the NFT drop?”

You write one feature in two months? Cool.  
You want to fork your own ICE system? Hell yeah.

This game is alive. It mutates. It adapts.  
And **you can help shape it.**

> Join the war.  
> Jack in.  
> Leave a trace.

**BLACKICE is waiting.**
