## ðŸ§¬ 14. Factions & Corporations

### Faction Types
| Type        | Traits |
|-------------|--------|
| Megacorps   | Control secure nodes, hostile to intruders |
| Corp |       | Smaller, less secure, but valuable |
| Rogue AIs   | Chaotic behavior, evolve over time |
| Netrunner Clans | Player-driven groups with territory |
| Neutral Syndicates | Info brokers, black market dealers |

Each faction could be NPC or player-run, with their own agendas and conflicts.

## ðŸ§¨ 15. Dynamic Event System

### Event Types
| Type         | Trigger |
|--------------|---------|
| Node War     | Faction conflict escalates to PvP siege |
| AI Awakening | Rogue AI hits singularity, changes ICE patterns |
| Black Market Flush | Market floods with rare goods, high Heat risk |
| Trace Storm  | Cyberspace-wide ICE upgrade, higher detection rolls |

### Event Structure
- Events run in real-time or time-locked windows
- Require player participation to resolve or exploit
- May leave:
  - Ruined nodes
  - Unstable programs
  - Unique loot

### Sample Event: **The Sprawl Surge**
- 10-minute notice to prepare
- A Glitch on the grid, All nearby nodes of coordinate (x,y) lose stealth protection
- Random ICE mutate
- High-tier loot drops guaranteedâ€”but logs explode with trace

## ðŸ§  16. Player-Driven Politics

### Reputation Over Time
