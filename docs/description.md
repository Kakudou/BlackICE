# 💀 **BLACKICE: The Node War**  
*A Cyberpunk Tactics Game of Infiltration, Deception, and Digital Warfare*

---

## 🧠 Overview

**BLACKICE** is a **hybrid cyberpunk strategy-RPG** for cli, telnet, discord, browser and  mobile, where players build, defend, and infiltrate complex node networks in real-time or turn-based tactical combat. Every decision, movement, and program executed leaves behind consequences—**traces, instability, risk. Even speech is a vector.**

You are not just a hacker. You're a **decker, a node architect, a rogue AI whisperer**, and a crew member in an ever-evolving digital war. Forge your persona, specialize your craft, and navigate a living Cyberspace where **the Net itself reacts to your presence.**

---

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Build** a digital node fortress with ICE, traps, data vaults, and backdoors.
2. **Craft** modular cyberdeck hardware and programs with chained capabilities.
3. **Infiltrate** other player nodes or corp-owned systems in ASCII-based, flow-logic architecture.
4. **Traverse** through cyberspace with risk-based routing, ICE detection, and unwanted encounters.
5. **Leave traces** and react to them—log signatures, movement alerts, or hostile ICE awakening.
6. **Communicate and roleplay** in dynamic chat systems where every word may be a lie or a trap.
7. **Upgrade, specialize, sabotage**—become legend, or be deleted.

## 🔧 Node Architecture

- Nodes are built using **ASCII-style layouts** and connected via **flow-logic scripting**.
- Defense includes:
  - **ICE Constructs** (Patrol, Guardian, Combat, Supervision, Spider)
  - **Programs** (Traps, databombs, loggers, watchdogs)
  - **Firewalls and choke points**
- **Backdoors** can be created for faster travel, but can be detected and hijacked by others.
- **Traversal leaves log trails**, and even passing through a node may trigger ICE or security.

---

## 🧭 Traversal System – “Every Step Leaves a Scar”

- Moving through cyberspace takes **time** and involves **routing through other nodes**.
- Each hop leaves behind:
  - **Log traces** ("Persona X routed through NODE-Y")
  - Possible **ICE reaction**
  - Chance of **forced encounters** or **rerouting** to unstable nodes
- **Backdoors** allow fast travel—but link nodes permanently and can be:
  - Discovered
  - Hijacked
  - Traced back to you

Smart players plan routes, spoof traces, or mask their hop trail—but **no movement is truly silent.**

## 🛠️ Cyberdeck & Program Loadouts

- Each deck has limited **slots** by type:
  - `M` Attack Programs
  - `N` Defense Programs
  - `O` Stealth/Utility Programs
- Hardware has stats: RAM, CPU speed, stability, overclock potential
- Overload or overheating causes:
  - Program freezing
  - Deck unresponsiveness
  - Long-term **hardware degradation**

### Crafting

- Programs and Cyberdeck parts are built using modular components:
  - `backdoor()`, `logger()`, `autoEject()`, `medicPatch()`, `spoofTrace()`
- Hardware can be:
  - **Overclocked** (adds speed, risks damage)
  - **Swapped/modded** (with rare components, trade-only gear)

---

## 🔐 Infiltration & Combat

- **Parser-style interface**:
  - `decrypt firewall`, `plant logger`, `spoof_trace`
- Behind each move is a **D20 skill system**:
  - `D20 + Skill + Modifier vs Difficulty Class (DC)`
- Success/failure generates real consequences:
  - Log traces
  - ICE spawn or deactivation
  - Node instability

---

## 🎲 Core Stats and Rolls

Skills include: `Stealth`, `Hacking`, `Engineering`, `Cybercombat`, `Logic`, `Evasion`

Rolls follow the format:  
**`D20 + Skill + Program/Cyberdeck Modifier` vs `DC`**

---

## 🧬 Player Growth Model (No Class, No Cap)

- No base classes. No hard level caps.
- Grow based on:
  - **Usage** (skills improve as you use them)
  - **Equipment** (hardware/software unlock capabilities)
  - **Reputation** (cred unlocks perks, deals, fear effects)
- Spec into one area deeply, or **diversify slowly with friction.**

---

## 🧨 System Reactions & Consequences

Everything leaves marks:

- Cyberdeck can **overheat**, **malfunction**, or even **burn out** during runs
- ICE gets **smarter** the more you interact with it
- Killing instead of bypassing? Expect **corp bounties** and **aggressive traces**
- **Programs can crash mid-run** or behave unpredictably based on node conditions
- Even **moving through a node** can trigger its ICE if you’ve built up too much Heat

---

## 📡 Reputation & Signal Heat

### Street Cred
- Gained through:
  - High-value breaches
  - Pulling off no-trace infiltrations
  - Code circulating the black market
- Unlocks:
  - Better vendor access
  - ICE debuffs from fear or hesitation

### Heat
- Built from:
  - Noise, kills, breaches, ICE destroyed
  - Routing through restricted nodes
- Increases:
  - Detection rates
  - Passive ICE aggression
  - Corp/Player bounty systems

---

## 💬 Dynamic Chat & Roleplay System

**There is no safe communication. The Cyberspace listens.**

### Chat Types
- **DMs**, **Crew Channels**, **Public Chat**, **Hub Broadcasts**
- Messages can be:
  - **Encrypted**
  - **Sniffed**
  - **Corrupted**
  - **Spoofed**

### Message Hijacking Tools

| Tool / Program       | Effect |
|----------------------|--------|
| `GhostTalker()`      | Sends anonymous, untraceable message |
| `EchoSnare()`        | Sniffs chat in surrounding nodes |
| `BlackInk()`         | Corrupts visible history on sender/receiver |
| `InjectMeme()`       | Spoofs UI messages (fake alerts) |
| `GhostKey()`         | Temporarily decrypts crew comms |
| `Whispershard()`     | Encodes message in noise—readable only with shard |
| `DeadEcho()`         | Self-deletes message from all logs |
| `ForkMessage()`      | Sends different versions to different recipients |
| `RelayLeech()`       | Logs comms routed through linked backdoor node |

### Manipulation Examples
- **MITM Attacks** on DMs via node traversal points
- **Spoofed responses** or delayed deliveries
- **Corrupted logs** for framing ops
- **Bait messages** that plant spyware when opened

Roleplay isn’t optional—it’s **part of the warfare**. You don’t just type to talk. You type to manipulate, deceive, or mislead. **Speech becomes a weapon.**

## 🧩 Mini-games & Subsystems

- **Log Cleaner** – Pattern match & decrypt under time pressure
- **Trace Delay** – Interrupt trace protocols by tapping intercept points
- **RAM Juggle** – Real-time slot management puzzle
- **Program Compiler** – Fit capabilities into shape-limited ROM shells

---

## 🧠 Summary

**BLACKICE** is a sandbox of sabotage where:
- **Movement has meaning**
- **Speech is a threat vector**
- **Your past can kill your future**
- And the **system remembers.**

You’re not grinding levels.  
You’re carving a legacy through digital shadows.

> *Build your fortress. Breach theirs. Every byte matters. Every trace is a threat.  
This isn’t just hacking—it’s war.*
