# üíæ Programs, Options & Execution Logic

Programs‚ÄîROMs, payloads, scripts‚Äîare the heartbeat of BLACKICE ops.  
They‚Äôre loaded into your cyberdeck and executed within nodes or during encounters.

Programs can be offensive, defensive, stealthy, supportive, or downright malicious.  
They cost RAM, require time to boot, and can **crash, misfire, or corrupt**.

## üß† Program Categories

### üõ° Security Programs
- `analyze()` ‚Äì Scan for constructs, databombs, and hidden logic  
- `encrypt()` ‚Äì Lock a file or data stream  
- `databomb()` ‚Äì Trap an asset with logic-triggered damage

- `stealth()` ‚Äì Mask or forge your persona  
- `crash()` ‚Äì Force errors on programs or nodes  

### ‚öîÔ∏è Cybercombat Programs
- `attack()` ‚Äì Standard digital damage to ICE or personas  
- `blackhammer()` ‚Äì Direct neural feedback assault (biofeedback)  
- `armor()` ‚Äì Reduce incoming code damage  
- `biofeedback_filter()` ‚Äì Absorbs physical feedback from ICE  

### üì° Electronic Warfare Tools
- `scan()` ‚Äì Detect hidden nodes or trap constructs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Logic

- **Load Cost:** Consumes RAM when loaded; some programs have persistent cost  
- **Execution Time:** Delay before effect; modifiable via gear  
- **Cooldown:** Required wait before reuse  
- **Stability:** Risk of crash or malfunction (affected by heat, traits)

## üß¨ ROM Snippet Library (Annex Extract)

> Snippets are the executable DNA of every BLACKICE ROM.  
> Tactical microcode that shapes behavior, cost, risk, and reward.

| `bio_piercer()`     | `damage`, `bio`      | Bypasses biofeedback filters to hit directly |
| `signal_flood()`    | `chaos`, `area`      | Overloads local signal space, disrupting all targets |
| `armor_breaker()`   | `damage`, `mod`      | Reduces ICE armor rating before applying damage |

Programs are spells, blades, viruses, tools, traps.  
Craft the ones that *burn right through the grid*.
