# üßç Persona, Cyberdeck & Skills

BLACKICE is built around the decker‚Äîthe runner, the ghost in the system. The player‚Äôs presence is split across two layers: the **persona** (your digital identity) and the **cyberdeck** (your rig, your weapon, your mind-machine).

## üßç Persona

The live actor in the cyberspace. Every action you take is tied to this construct.

| Attribute         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `energy_bar`     | Persona health; affected by biofeedback and trace stress |
| `action_bar`     | Available actions per cycle (turn-based or cooldown) |
| `trace_meter`    | Visibility on the network; higher = more ICE reaction |
| `level`          | Long-term engagement metric |
| `skillsheet`     | Your abilities in key domains (see below) |
| `inventory`      | ROMs, programs, access keys, data payloads |

## üíª Cyberdeck

Your hardware in the system. A modular build that defines performance, loadouts, and limits.

| Module        | Role |
|---------------|------|
| `RAM`         | Determines how many programs you can load at once |
| `CPU`         | Affects execution speed and cooldown |
| `energy_core` | Overall power supply; tied to sustained actions |
| `modules`     | Slot-based enhancements (cooling, filters, overclock tools) |
| `skillsheet`  | Cyberdeck-specific optimizations |
| `inventory`   | Installed hardware and backup ROMs |

## üõ†Ô∏è Deck Actions

- `equip_deck()` ‚Äì Change loadout, swap gear
- `repair_deck()` ‚Äì Restore deck modules post-crash
- `connect_net()` / `disconnect_net()` ‚Äì Enter or leave the cyberspace
- `hotsim()` / `coldsim()` ‚Äì Toggle between full-immersion or buffered mode
- `intercept_transfer()` ‚Äì Capture outgoing data from your node
- `block_transfer()` ‚Äì Actively prevent external data ops

## üß† Skill Domains

| Skill             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Cybercombat**   | Offensive capability, ICE damage, persona attack rolls |
| **Security (InfoSec)** | File analysis, detection, decryption, program diagnostics |
| **Electronic Warfare** | Node sniffing, jamming, spoofing, protocol hijacking |
| **Hacking**       | Intrusion, stealth ops, backdoor injection |
| **Data Research** | File indexing, loot identification, AI parsing |
| **Hardware**      | Deck maintenance, component crafting, overclock management |
| **Software**      | ROM crafting, debugger usage, program optimization |

Each roll = `D20 + Skill + Modifiers`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Interactions

- Persona and Cyberdeck operate as **linked layers**
- Damage to one can affect the other (feedback loops, RAM drains)
- Both can be modified via crafting, loot, or black market trades
